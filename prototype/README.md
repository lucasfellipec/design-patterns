# Prototype

Specify the types of objects to be created using a prototype instance and create new objects by copying this prototype.

Objects are directly linked to othmealer objects.

The type of object to be created is determined by the prototype object.

Prevents subclass explosion.

It's just created with a "clone" method inside the prototype object.

Shallow or Deep copy.

Prevents the client from knowing the classes that create the objects.

## Applicability

- Use the prototype pattern when you need your code not to depend on concrete classes to create new objects.
